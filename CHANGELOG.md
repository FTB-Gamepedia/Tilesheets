# Changelog
This changelog only shows recent version history, because of the lack of documentation from the former maintainers. The very first changelog (1.1.2) is likely incomplete.

## Version 5
### 5.0.3
* Fix error when trying to delete a sheet through the SheetManager (#115/miraheze T14091).
* Fix potential SQL injection vulnerability in the SheetManager (SomeMWDev) (

### 5.0.2
* Escape tilesheet import return messages, resolves potential security vulnerability. Same as in OreDict#87 / T360557.

### 5.0.1
* Update for MediaWiki 1.41 (#111, #97, PR #113 for 1.39 changes).
* Add tracking category descriptions for Special:TrackingCategories
* Archive upgrade/sql files from old updates.
* Undeleting pages now updates the tilelinks table for Special:WhatUsesThisTile

### 5.0.0
* Fix license name in Special:Version (#99, #100) (xbony2)
* Implement Z coordinate for tiles (ext_tilesheet_items table) (#76, #98, somewhat related to #82)
  * Tilesheet images are now required to be at File:Tilesheet {abbrv} {size} {z}.png (upgrade will require moving all to Z 0).
  * Z coordinate allows for there to be multiple tilesheet images for a single sheet/mod with overlapping X/Y coordinates. This is needed for very large mods whose tilesheets exceed the image size limit (GregTech and others) or for mods which have multiple tilesheets for different purposes (Thaumcraft and Witchery possibly)
  * CreateTileSheet, TileList, and TileManager are all updated to account for the new Z coordinate.
  * addtiles, edittile, and querytiles should all be updated to account for the new Z coordinate (only querytiles was tested, however the code used is the special page code, so I do not see any reason it will not work).
  * Upgrade requires running a SQL script to add the column with NULL, populate it with 0, and then set NOT NULL. This script is located at upgrade/sql/ext_tilesheet_items/add_z_coordinate.sql
  * `#icon`/`#iconloc` are entirely unchanged, meaning nothing on the wiki aside from tilesheet images will need to be updated.
  * Import format is now X Y Z Item Name. This will need to be updated in ftb-rs

### 4.3.0
* Update our special pages to use OOUI (#96).

### 4.2.3

  * ViewTile (hackily) displays a WhatUsesThisTile link in the sidebar tools section.
  * New list query API for getting tile backlinks.
* Fix type in Version special page so that it is correctly put into the parser hooks section (#77)

### 4.0.1
* Improve tile searching code in TileList.
  * Fix blank-regex searching issue. When mod, formattedEntryIDs, or regex are empty, instead of doing `whatever = ''`, the condition is simply omitted. This fixes the issue where it was searching for regex `//` instead of `item_name = ''` (#57 and #58).

  * API no longer has name, x, and y parameters.
  * Return value is in the "addtiles" object, not the "addtile" object.
* Set entry_id and lang as a composite primary key for lang table (#50 and #48)

  * New table in the database ext_tilesheet_languages that has 4 rows: `entry_id`, `lang`, `display_name`, and `description`
  * New special page TileTranslator where translators can translate tilesheet icon display names and descriptions for their languages. This will create a log entry.
    * Default display names and descriptions can be added by translating to `en`. This will override the default functionality, which can be useful for things like Clay (Item) which should be shown as simply Clay.
  * New `#iconloc` parser function to get the localized name or description for a tilesheet item. It takes 4 arguments: item name, mod abbreviation, type (name or description), and language code.
